A responsive BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features a modern space-themed design with plasma colors and smooth animations.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

- **Assets**: Images and icons stored in `/assets` directory
- **Pages**: Multi-page structure with separate HTML files in `/html` directory
- **Scripts**: Modular JavaScript files in `/script` directory
- **Styles**: Component-based CSS files in `/styles` directory

## Key Features
- BMI calculation with category classification (Underweight, Healthy, Overweight, Obesity)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Space-themed UI with plasma colors and smooth animations
- Multi-page navigation (Home, Calculator, About, Profile)
- Form validation and reset functionality
